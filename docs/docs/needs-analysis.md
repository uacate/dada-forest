1. Desired Performance  
When data sets become more broadly available through government systems.  
Interim solution: data subsets in beta on UofA systems and then move those to government systems maintained by current USFS computer staff (BH, email, 2/22/2024).  
    1.1 Target Group  
        TBD    
    1.2 Desired Performance/Behaviors  
        TBD  
    1.3 Regulatory Requirements (determine need for training, if applicable)  
        TBD  
    1.4 Program or business expectations for performance  
        TBD  

2. Current Performance  
    2.1 Interview subject matter experts  
    2.2 Interview supervisors to determine current performance from their perspective  
    2.3 Observe work or work outputs of representatives of target audience  
    2.4 Review relevant self-assessments, reports, lessons learned, near misses, etc, for understanding performance from available sources  
    
3. Performance Gaps and Causes  
    Use [Carl Binder Six Boxes model](https://www.sixboxes.com/Six-Boxes-Model.html) to determine factors that affect performance or factors that improve performance

4. Solutions  
    3.1 Deterine what needs are most critical  
    3.2 Determine possible solutions for most critical needs  
    It is important to include all non-training factors that impede performance so that training is positioned alongside other interventions emphasizing the
complimentary and related dependencies that form the recommended solution  
    3.3 Prepare a recommendation report
