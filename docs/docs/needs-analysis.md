1. Desired Performance  
When data sets become more broadly available through government systems.  
Interim solution: data subsets in beta on UofA systems and then move those to government systems maintained by current USFS computer staff.  

    * Target Group(s)  
        * USDA/USFS (et al.)
    * Desired Performance/Behaviors  
        * Measured product usage through system monitoring (e.g., log files, application analytics, ...) 
    * Regulatory Requirements (determine need for training, if applicable)  
        * Accessibilty requirements (e.g., ARIA)
    * Program or business expectations for performance  
        * Application, database, resource up-time, speed, data accuracy

2. Current Performance  
    * Interview subject matter experts  
        * USDA/USFS personel  
        * University of Arizona personel  
        * Others  
    * Interview supervisors to determine current performance from their perspective  
        * Brian Heidorn (The University of Arizona)  
        * David Rugg (USDA/USFS)  
        * Others  
    * Observe work or work outputs of representatives of target audience  
        * What other data services or catalogs exist at the USDA/USFS or The University of Arizona that could be used as comparisons?  
    * Review relevant self-assessments, reports, lessons learned, near misses, etc, for understanding performance from available sources  
        * How do we measure success going forward?  
    
3. Performance Gaps and Causes  
    
4. Solutions  
    * Determine what needs are most critical  
    * Determine possible solutions for most critical needs  
    It is important to include all non-training factors that impede performance so that training is positioned alongside other interventions emphasizing the complimentary and related dependencies that form the recommended solution
    * Prepare a recommendation report
