Objectives
==========

1. Research, develop, and test a plan to meet Evidence Act requirements for a comprehensive Forest Service data inventory, including metadata, and accompanying searchable data catalog. This is envisioned to be a multi-step process involving researching metadata standards relevant to Forest Service work; researching and evaluating potential data catalogs relevant to Forest Service work; evaluating selected metadata and data catalog components on at least one substantive body of Forest Service data.  Finally, meet Geospatial Data Act requirements.  

    USFS Relevent metadata standards include:  

    1. Federal Geographic Data Committee's "Content Standard for Digital Geospatial Metadata" (CSDGM) also referred to as FGDC metadta.  
    2. [ISO 19115-X core-family](https://www.fgdc.gov/metadata/iso-suite-of-geospatial-metadata-standards) (19115-1, 19115-2, 19115-3), where 19115-1 and 19115-2, 19115-3 typically apply to content standards and 19115-3 typically applies to XML formatting standards.  Also included are 19110 (feature catalog standard) and 19157 (data quality).  
    3. DCAT-US ver 1.1, also known as "Project Open Data metadata" (used by data.gov).  

2. Inventory and catalog datasets (including metadata, glossaries, data dictionaries, etc.) related to the Wildfire Crisis Strategy. Inventorying / cataloging other datasets is a longterm interest of the Forest Service and can be incorporated into this project as time allows.  
3. Create and test connections between the selected Forest Service data catalog platform and the USDA enterprise data catalog and data governance platform (currently Axon)  

4. Research, develop, and test the proposed data publication capability using a subset of the inventory from Objective 2. Ensure published datasets are marketed through the Federal data catalog (currently data.gov) and, for geospatial datasets, the Federal Geographic Data Committeeâ€™s GeoPlatform.
