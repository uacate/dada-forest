## Comprehensive USFS Data Inventory  

### Project Objectives  
**Objective 1**:  
Research, develop, and test a plan to meet Evidence Act requirements for a comprehensive Forest Service data inventory, including metadata, and accompanying searchable data catalog. This is envisioned to be a multi-step process involving researching metadata standards relevant to Forest Service work; researching and evaluating potential data catalogs relevant to Forest Service work; evaluating selected metadata and data catalog components on at least one substantive body of Forest Service data.  Finally, meet Geospatial Data Act requirements.  

USFS Relevent metadata standards include:  

1. Federal Geographic Data Committee's "Content Standard for Digital Geospatial Metadata" (CSDGM) also referred to as FGDC metadta.  
2. ISO 19115-X core-family (19115-1, 19115-2, 19115-3), where 19115-1 and 19115-2, 19115-3 typically apply to content standards and 19115-3 typically applies to XML formatting standards.  Also included are 19110 (feature catalog standard) and 19157 (data quality).  
3. DCAT-US ver 1.1, also known as "Project Open Data metadata" (used by data.gov).  

**Objective 2**:  
Inventory and catalog datasets (including metadata, glossaries, data dictionaries, etc.) related to the Wildfire Crisis Strategy. Inventorying / cataloging other datasets is a longterm interest of the Forest Service and can be incorporated into this project as time allows.  

**Objective 3**:  
Create and test connections between the selected Forest Service data catalog platform and the USDA enterprise data catalog and data governance platform (currently Axon)  

**Objective 4**:  
Research, develop, and test the proposed data publication capability using a subset of the inventory from Objective 2. Ensure published datasets are marketed through the Federal data catalog (currently data.gov) and, for geospatial datasets, the Federal Geographic Data Committeeâ€™s GeoPlatform.
