## Comprehensive USFS Data Inventory  

### Project Objectives  
**Objective 1**: Research, develop, and test a plan to meet Evidence Act requirements for a comprehensive Forest Service data inventory, including metadata, and accompanying searchable data catalog. This is envisioned to be a multi-step process involving researching and evaluating metadata standards relevant to Forest Service work; researching and evaluating potential data catalogs relevant to Forest Service work; evaluating selected metadata and data catalog components on at least one substantive body of Forest Service data.  

**Objective 2**: Inventory and catalog datasets (including metadata, glossaries, data dictionaries, etc.) related to the Wildfire Crisis Strategy. Inventorying / cataloging other datasets is a longterm interest of the Forest Service and can be incorporated into this project as time allows.  

**Objective 3**: Create and test connections between the selected Forest Service data catalog platform and the USDA enterprise data catalog and data governance platform (currently Axon)  

**Objective 4**: Research, develop, and test the proposed data publication capability using a subset of the inventory from Objective 2. Ensure published datasets are marketed through the Federal data catalog (currently data.gov) and, for geospatial datasets, the Federal Geographic Data Committeeâ€™s GeoPlatform.
